Beholden to ancient evils: Check.&nbsp; Can see you in the dark: Check.&nbsp; Now let me ask you this… why are you wanting to go stir up a nest of Drow?<br><strong>- a subterranean guide.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Drow were once the very same elves of the woods and cities we are more commonly aware of; however, a schism within the belief structures of various elvish factions forced a sect of elvenkind to flee below the surface of the world and take refuge within the massive subterranean caverns they found there.&nbsp; Within the caves their skin darkened to a deep pitch black and their hair faded to shades of white and silver.&nbsp; These elves, thin and regal in posture, became known as simply the Drow.&nbsp; As centuries passed beneath the world’s crust, the Drow adapted to their new surroundings in notable ways.</p>\n<p><strong>You Think the Darkness is your Ally?</strong>&nbsp;The Drow’s elven eyes, once adapted to see for miles in the bright sunlight, grew pale without the nourishment of the light and transformed into orbs keen at seeing anything within the pitch darkness of the underground.&nbsp; Drow have also learned to use the darkness to their advantage and may even creep to the surface world under the cover of night’s shadows to carry out raids upon villages nearby.&nbsp; This adaptation has not come without cost, however, as the Drow’s skin and eyes can no longer stand the burning sun.&nbsp; This forces the dark elves to utilize the night or sufficiently cover themselves to avoid the sun’s glare.&nbsp; Drow do still retain some of their elvish arcane abilities as they may not be charmed or forced to sleep by spellwork.&nbsp; Many Drow females (as Drows exist in a matriarchy) are also skilled sorcerers and priestesses who primarily choose to side with gods on the more sinister side of the pantheon.&nbsp; Other clever Drow have worked out methods of distilling certain poisons from underground mushrooms and creatures who lurk upon the cavern walls.&nbsp; These toxins are well known amongst connoisseurs of poisons for both their availability as well as their legendary potency.&nbsp; It is not uncommon for all soldiers in a Drow army to be equipped with at least one vial of potent poison.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Neutral Evil","race":null,"type":"Humanoid (Elf)","environment":"Underdark","cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"MM pg. 128","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["elvish","undercommon"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ste":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":14,"prof":2,"total":4},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"lqq7AC8UiPDuwneP","sort":1100000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Drow","displayName":0,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":120,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"1vaBSMUfOy6JPJ14","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{},"bar2":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"Jwx7Sfs5m3RDWckF","name":"Fey Ancestry","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The drow has<strong> advantage </strong>on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put the drow to sleep.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":"","value":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell","value":""},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"attunement":0},"sort":200001,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/green_13.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"A4OySWt5j3QXyAPW","name":"Innate Spellcasting","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The drow's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 11).

Spiders are arachnids with eight thin legs protruding from their dual-segmented body. Atop the spider’s tiny head are eight glistening eyes with which it views the world in relative obscurity. While the spider’s eyesight may be poor regardless of the number of eyes, they have a clever trick up their sleeves: the spider’s web!</p>\n<p><strong>Some Bug.</strong> Ingenious little architects, spiders produce a silken thread from their rears dubbed “webbing” which they use to construct elaborate homes. Resembling something of a net, the spider’s web serves a dual purpose: to capture food upon its sticky surface and to give the spider a safe place to perch away from predators. Once an insect is trapped within the web, the spider quickly wraps the unsuspecting creature in a bundle of webbing, saving its prize for later consumption. While all spiders are venomous in some capacity, many will not be harmful to the adventurer on their travels. Simply avoid webs where you see them and be quite sure that the web which you see only belongs to a standard spider species, as a plethora of gigantic and magical varieties also lurk within similar webs!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Unaligned","race":null,"type":"Beast","environment":null,"cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg. 337","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"tiny","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ste":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":14,"prof":2,"total":4},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"rjehyX85FDoydEwV","sort":1400000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/Spider.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Spider","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/Spider.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":0.8,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":30,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"28gU50HtG8Kp7uIz","actorLink":false,"disposition":0,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"0Oap13hi3sDNwVZn","name":"Spider Climb","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"attunement":0},"sort":100000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/green_23.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"ysV0KgiPcJOYCdMh","name":"Bite","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\"><p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+4 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one creature.

These octopods resemble nothing more than a wet piece of bulbous taffy with eight sprawling tentacles slithering out of its central body. Upon this gelatinous body lie two observant eyes and were one to look underneath the creature they would find a sharpened bird-like beak ready to steal a probing finger away. Octopi are solely waterborne animals due to their inability to breathe air, though with effort they may remain upon land for very short durations. Sailors find pleasure in attempting to take these intelligent beasts for pets, only to find that the octopus has escaped whatever confines it was stored in time and time again. As long as an opening is as wide as its hard chitinous beak, the moldable octopus’ body will follow into inconceivably tight spaces.</p>\n<p>Many breeds of octopus also bear special pigmentation cells which expand and contract to change their body’s color. This provides the octopus with an advantage when hunting for its prey of fish and crabs as they can blend in almost seamlessly with the ocean floor or a bed of coral. Rather than outright fight (unless left with no choice) the octopus has the unique defense of spraying a cloud of ink from the underside of its body to blind its foes and make a speedy escape. Do consider the octopus as a worthy familiar form should you find yourself at sea for an extended time!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Unaligned","race":null,"type":"Beast","environment":null,"cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg. 333","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"sm","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ste":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":14,"prof":2,"total":4},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"eDEsGNylMOfsjoZR","sort":100000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/Octopus.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Octopus","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/Octopus.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":30,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"3UUNbGiG2Yf1ZPxM","actorLink":false,"disposition":0,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"SLnyx0Ta2ksVM9QL","name":"Tentacles","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\"><p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+4 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one target.

These hardy ruminant beasts ranging from four and a half to nearly seven feet in height and subsist primarily upon the leaves of the forest floor and plants of the plains. Deer present with noticeable sexual dimorphism; the males or “bucks” brandish large multi-pronged racks of antlers upon their heads which they shed and regrow annually. Female deer, or “does”, lack the antlers of their male counterparts but are no less hardy when it comes to defending their herds.</p>\n<p><strong>Oh Deer, oh Deer</strong>. Deer are commonly docile creatures who will often flee at the first sight of any humanoid wandering into their domain. However, should you be unfortunate enough to encounter a buck during their mating season, you should consider taking a different path. Male deer’s antlers can easily pierce weaker armor and flesh, tearing through a body as easily as a spear. Should you walk too close to a doe’s precious children (or fawns) you will most assuredly experience the taste of the mother’s hardened hooves upon you packing an uncanny amount of force for such nimble frames. Deer, when an adventurer’s survival is considered, are best hunted from a distance to avoid these vicious melee defenses.

To the untrained eye, elk simply look much like a gigantic deer as males retain the characteristic pronged antlers (females bearing none) as their smaller cousins.&nbsp; There are, however, a few differences between the two creatures.&nbsp; The most notable difference is in vocalization as elk favor a series of bugles or shrieks which echo loudly throughout the forest.&nbsp; These bugling vocalizations signal the arrival of mating season (called a rut) in which dominant males will battle between themselves with sharpened antlers for a female’s favor.&nbsp; Should you hear the keening cry of the elk in a silent forest, may I advise you that you should best turn back lest you are ready for a pheromone addled fight to the end.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Unaligned","race":null,"type":"Beast","environment":"Grassland","cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"MM pg. 322","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"lg","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13,"prof":0,"total":3},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"ABTRAPMTNJLwRCe1","sort":400000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/Elk.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Elk","displayName":0,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/Elk.png","tint":null,"width":2,"height":2,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"55PkbskG5iBZGrgR","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"slVyUWagsSZ5CXSh","name":"Charge","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>If the elk moves at least 20 ft. straight toward a target and then hits it with a ram attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) damage.</p>\n<p>If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a  <strong>DC 13 Strength</strong> saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>\n</section>\n<p>If the elk moves at least 20 ft. straight toward a target and then hits it with a ram attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra damage.

I still have the damnable sting blisters from their catapults. WASPS! WHAT CREATURE PUTS WASPS IN BAGS AND THROWS THEM AT YOU?! Next Kobold I see I'm turning to paste…\"<br>- Guard Captain Nathaniel Greenbow, interviewed for this bestiary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Kobolds are conniving, cowardly humanoids of a reptilian appearance who infest the dungeons, catacombs, and caverns of our world. Appearing as tiny dragonoids with scaled flesh and crocodile-like snouts, Kobolds are perhaps more clever than their outward appearance would lead one to believe. Within their tiny heads (as the creatures stand no more than two and a half feet tall) lies a brain churning with myriad ideas, though many include idiotically dangerous schemes. It is not uncommon for many Kobolds to perish before their first complete decade of life.</p>\n<p><strong>Mob Mentality.</strong> Kobolds, much like rodents, breed at an astonishingly quick rate as compared to other humanoid species. Egg-layers like their draconic kin, Kobolds mature rapidly upon emerging from their shells, and assume their place within the ranks of their chittering society. Even upon reaching maturity, however, the Kobold is still a weak creature causing the colonies to stick together when exploring or hunting. Though Kobolds may defeat larger foes with sheer numbers, it is often at the cost of massive casualties on the Kobold's side. This, of course, hardly deters the resentful Kobolds, who have more eggs incubating away with the next infantry reinforcements just moments away from joining the fold.</p>\n<p><strong>Launch the Centipult.</strong> Stupid yet clever, Kobolds truly excel at two things: burrow-making and creating traps for unwary adventurers. Traps, of course, are the Kobold's speciality and they take relish in littering their lairs with copious defenses hewn from the natural resources of their home. Perhaps crushing logs were torn from the rafter struts of an abandoned temple, or carnivorous insects were placed into dropping ceramic pots to smash down upon foolish intruders. Never underestimate the ability of a Kobold to find some unsuspected way to impede your progress.</p>\n<p><strong>Trade Offs.</strong> Though strong in numbers, Kobolds may be defeated in several ways. Firstly, the creatures are born and mature within near total darkness, thus the sun weakens them and blinds their sensitive eyes. Kobolds are also nigh defenseless without the aid of their allies at their backs; often a lone Kobold with attempt to scurry away should they be caught out without their pack. Greedy and determined when it comes to self-preservation, Kobolds may be easily manipulated with smooth talk or a shiny trinket to line their pockets. Draconic in nature as well, the scuttling dragonoids can be used as crude translators of the dragon's tongue should you require such services on your journey.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by

Named for its vibrant purple cap, the violet fungus loses all semblance to an average mushroom there.&nbsp; Standing tall upon a thick white trunk, the violet fungus creeps across cavern floors at a laborious pace utilizing tiny cillia-like tendrils at its base.&nbsp; Keeping this snail’s pace, the violet fungus roams the depths for its preferred sustenance: rotting flesh.&nbsp; Should a living morsel wander precariously close to the fungus, the violet fungus will lash out with one of four long feeler tentacles rooted deep inside its purple cap.&nbsp; These feelers contain special enzymes which, upon contact with living flesh, rots the organic material instantly.&nbsp; Should a creature fall victim to the fungus, it will be consumed along with the other detritus littering the cavern floor.&nbsp; Violet fungi themselves have a special relationship with the death they consume.&nbsp; A violet fungus that is destroyed will regrow within two weeks from the remains of its former body should the remains not be fully burned.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Unaligned","race":null,"type":"Plant","environment":"Underdark","cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"MM pg. 138","class":{},"size":"med"},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["blinded","deafened","frightened"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"RCqDAUEk193jomBI","sort":300000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/plant/VioletFungus.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Violet Fungus","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/plant/VioletFungus.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":30,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"7EmUVycEASn7SFL0","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"OEx9iy4HDipiYsPt","name":"Rotting Touch","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\"><p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+2 to hit,</strong>, <strong>10 ft.,</strong> one creature.

I swear it’s true!<br><em>- Unknown Disorderly Patron at the Brass Buck Tavern.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What more could be said about the humble crab than is not already common knowledge to those who live near or frequent the coasts of the continent. Crabs are uniquely robust little creatures often no larger than the palm of an adult human’s hand, with eight segmented legs protruding from either side of its scallop-shaped carapace. This hardened chitin carapace is topped with two black eye stalks (not unlike those of a snail) through which the beast views our coastlines and oceans. It has been observed that some species of crab lack an armored shell and prefer to squat in the discarded shells of conchs. This gives the crab a rather clever and sturdy mobile home. Adorning the crabs ninth and tenth appendages near its tiny mouth are two massive claws, resembling those of a scorpion, with dull serrations marking the inner edge of each. The crab primarily utilizes these claws in its search for food, cracking open the shells of other tiny aquatic beasts or snipping off tiny pieces of undersea plant life to dine on.</p>\n<p>While perhaps not the most dangerous companion a summoner could wish for, the crab’s ability to breath both in the water and upon land makes the crustacean an ally brimming with utility. I advise caution, however, when first looking through your crab familiar’s eyes, as the sideways scuttling by which the crab moves has proven to cause vomiting in some weak stomached summoners.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Unaligned","race":null,"type":"Beast","environment":"Coastal","cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg. 320","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"tiny","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"ZSWBRlk2vsD2qKZC","sort":1500000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/CrabOrange.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Crab","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/CrabOrange.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":30,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"8RgUhb31VvjUNZU1","actorLink":false,"disposition":0,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"gvfgesIscW0VALbY","name":"Claw","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+0 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one target.

Weasels are tiny, long bodied mammals reaching approximately eight inches in length and bearing coat colorations ranging from chestnut brown to pale white. The weasel’s long body allows it to easily wedge itself into a rodent’s burrow and pull the critter out for a tasty meal. Weasels make quite effective pest controllers in their territories as they eat multitudes of rodents annually. These little cleaners are, however, often considered to be pests in their own right; farmers across the countryside report that their poultry is killed or stolen away by sneaky weasels making their way into their chicken coops. While not the most deadly mammal in the world, the weasel does pack a nasty, sharp-toothed bite.

Common place from the sprawling urban metropolis to the tiny barn of a poor farmer, rats inhabit every nook and cranny they may scurry in to.&nbsp; These small rodents, who can range in size from no bigger than your palm to the length of a forearm (with tail included) are quite ingenious little thieves.&nbsp; Rats are able to compress their bodies in such a manner that they can fit through spaces as small as the gap in the bottom of your door.&nbsp; Able to swim and navigate in the dark, some rats have been observed climbing out of small plumbing pipes, having scampered through the length of the tunnel to make it inside a merchant’s abode.</p>\n<p><strong>Rats Off to You.</strong> While many may dismiss the rat as nothing more than a common pest, even those not utilized as magical familiars are highly intelligent little creatures.&nbsp; Researchers have observed rats completing complex mazes, solving lever-action puzzles, and understanding the world around them to a degree unseen in other animals.&nbsp; A clever street-dweller could certainly train a rat to filch food or a few shiny coins from an unwatched coin purse, should the rat get adequate reward itself.&nbsp; Do be wise in your selection of companion, however, as some rats carry deadly diseases from insects that nestle in their short fur.&nbsp; Along with its sharp, clinging claws, the rat packs a powerful bite thanks to its elongated incisor teeth.&nbsp; Be observant, young hero, should you see a rat nearby, for the simple creature may house a secret within its black, unblinking eyes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Unaligned","race":null,"type":"Beast","environment":"Swamp","cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"MM pg. 339","class":{},"size":"med"},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":["bludgeoning","piercing","slashing"],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["charmed","frightened","grappled","paralyzed","petrified","prone","restrained","stunned"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"rjehyX85FDoydEwV","sort":2900000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/SwarmRats.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Swarm of Rats","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/SwarmRats.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":30,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"8ihbbjkaOFTPbI73","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"EsvdwAvnKR0SGP6R","name":"Keen Smell","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The swarm has<strong> advantage </strong>on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":"","type":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":"","value":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell","value":""},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"attunement":0},"sort":100000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/blue_29.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"ARmqveDkUL48Hupc","name":"Swarm","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny rat.

I swear it's true!!!\"</p>\n<p>- Unknown Disorderly Patron at the Brass Buck Tavern.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>What more could be said about the humble crab than is not already common knowledge to those who live near or frequent the coasts of the continent. Crabs are uniquely robust little creatures often no larger than the palm of an adult human's hand, with eight segmented legs protruding from either side of its scallop-shaped carapace. This hardened chitin carapace is topped with two black eye stalks (not unlike those of a snail) through which the beast views our coastlines and oceans. It has been observed that some species of crab lack an armored shell and prefer to squat in the discarded shells of conchs. This gives the crab a rather clever and sturdy mobile home. Adorning the crabs ninth and tenth appendages near its tiny mouth are two massive claws, resembling those of a scorpion, with dull serrations marking the inner edge of each. The crab primarily utilizes these claws in its search for food, cracking open the shells of other tiny aquatic beasts or snipping off tiny pieces of undersea plant life to dine on.</p>\n</section>\n<p>While perhaps not the most dangerous companion a summoner could wish for, the crab's ability to breath both in the water and upon land makes the crustacean an ally brimming with utility.

You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</p>\n<p><strong>Off Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p>\n<p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p>\n<p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey.

I strayed from my mentor, a priest in his middle years with a soft voice and ring of grey-dappled hair about a balding head, to approach a statue set aside within a shadowed alcove.&nbsp; It depicted our god in his humanoid form, an elderly man standing strictly at attention, his wild hair hanging as long as his chest length beard, a staff topped with a stern faced sun clutched in his hand.&nbsp; I knelt, still only fourteen, before this statue and began to pray right then.&nbsp; The next six years of my acolyte training would be nothing but a blessing, I knew.&nbsp;<br><em>“The Gleaming Star”, by Bishop Bernard Portis.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Acolytes are those devoted followers of a particular goddess or god who have decided to take on the mantle of the clergy to better serve their chosen deity.&nbsp; Often no older than teenagers (though some acolytes begin later in their lives) acolytes are trained for a number of years (typically between three to ten) depending on the strictures of their deity’s doctrines.&nbsp; During their time they memorize and study all written materials concerning their deity and their teachings, learn magics (be they healing or harmful) gifted to the acolytes by their deities, and often go out into their community to provide aid to those in need or proselytize the words of their goddess or god.&nbsp; Though not every acolyte climbs the ranks into full fledged priesthood, many remain highly dedicated to the church and remain to serve as life-long acolytes working closely with the lay community outside the temple walls.</p>\n<p>Recall that acolytes are trained in the arcane ways of their chosen deities.&nbsp; This being the case, acolytes rarely receive sufficient martial training in comparison to the paladin ranks of the temple (unless expressly dictated otherwise by their deity’s teachings).&nbsp; This being the case, the acolyte is able to unleash some basic divine magic in order to both defend themselves and allies or to call upon their patron deity for aid for injured parties.&nbsp; Typically expelled in a gleaming shower of golden sparks and dazzlingly vibrant lights, the magic of the gods is truly something special, even at such a base nature.&nbsp; Spells such as Cure Wounds, Sacred Flame, or Sanctuary are all practiced by acolytes early on into their divine studies.&nbsp; Acolytes can make handy allies should you be in need of divine protection or a field medic for an injured compatriot.&nbsp; Be sure to mind your acolyte well, however, as their spellwork can easily be interrupted if they are forced into a melee fight with a band of slavering gnolls.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any","race":null,"type":"Humanoid","environment":null,"cr":0.25,"spellLevel":1,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"MM pg. 342","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"Any one language (usually common)"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":14,"prof":2,"total":4},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":1,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":2,"override":2,"max":2},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"6DauPtHPdkuwtDcK","sort":200000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/Acolyte.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Acolyte","displayName":0,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/Acolyte.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"CHEUjiYrVM9X0vIT","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"38I6bGoguRRefN6W","name":"Spellcasting","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>The acolyte is a 1st-level spellcaster.

Resembling nothing more than a scaly worm at first look, snakes are actually highly developed predators who slither across the ground in order to stealthily hunt their prey of smaller reptiles, rodents, and birds. Though there are many species of snake, we will only discuss the poisonous varieties within this article. Poisonous snakes bear a marked identifier separating them from their nonpoisonous brethren: the shape of their pupils. While snakes lacking venom glands have rounded pupils, those snakes with a venomous bite have slitted pupils much like those of a common domestic cat. The devious snake, however, has so much more beneath its scaly surface.</p>\n<p><strong>Don't Tread on Me.</strong> Ever camouflaged both by their similarities to roots, sticks, or branches as well as the marvelous patterns of black, browns, greens, and tans speckling their hides, snakes are masters of blending into their surroundings. Even perched on a rock to warm their bodies in the heat of the sun, snakes can certainly be missed by just a passing glance. While the creature's eyesight is relatively poor, snakes have adapted an amazing ability to sense the world around them. Snakes \"smell\" with their tongues! Yes, by flicking their tongues out of their mouths with a fascinating flourish, these reptiles are able to smell prey or predators in their environment by collecting the miniscule scents on their tongues. Within the snake's mouth lies its most deadly asset in the form of two, hollow fangs. Snakes prefer to strike from the shadows, allowing their quiet method of travel to get them close enough to their prey to avoid a fight. The creature then lashes out in the blink of an eye, catching the unwary prey in their jaws while injecting them with a controlled dose of highly toxic venom through their hollow fangs. Then it's only a matter of moments until the poor creature is left dead by the snake's potent toxins. While the majority of snake species are not deadly to humanoids, caution is advised for those not well versed in identifying reptiles. Antidote should always be carried in areas known to house populations of poisonous snakes, just in case.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Unaligned","race":null,"type":"Beast","environment":"Grassland","cr":0.125,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":25},"source":"MM pg. 334","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"tiny","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13,"prof":0,"total":3},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13,"prof":0,"total":3},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13,"prof":0,"total":3},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"B3XQZKLaaIqhaEFM","sort":600000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/PoisonousSnake.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Poisonous Snake","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/PoisonousSnake.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":10,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"D5rwVIxmfFrdyyxT","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"obYv0JJqJiMTsoIF","name":"Bite","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\"><p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+5 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one target.

Dwellers of the coastal urban sprawl see the armored law keepers near daily as they patrol the streets, guard our gates, inspect shipments, and of course assist (or arrest) those citizens of their fair cities. However, the guard is not only bound by the gates and ramparts of a city's walls. Be they mercenary or professional, guards are often found patrolling the roads, either to sweep away stray packs of animals or bandits, or on alert to protect precious cargo or important citizens as they travel the less settled areas of the world. Much like the bandits and cultists who we have previously discussed in this tome, guards come in all varieties. Though many may seem to be highly trained and regimented, it should be considered that most guards see no more action than a tussle on the busy streets of a market or scattering a few bandit scavengers from an upturned wagon. Guards are not all the hardened and grizzled ex-military types we think of at the upper ranks of the orders. Be observant, young adventurer, and heed the warnings of the law, for while the guards may only be a minor threat to your dastardly visions, what lays in wait in the city dungeon may not be worth the risks!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any Alignment","race":null,"type":"Humanoid","environment":null,"cr":0.125,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":25},"source":"MM pg. 347","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"any one language (usually Common)"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"kdTgTyvlimxTW5xZ","sort":4800000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/GuardBlueM.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Guard","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/GuardBlueM.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"E9CvDPDg5dFEpVjS","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"2reHgwNJRFbhmxqA","name":"Chain Shirt","type":"equipment","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather.

Eagles are noble birds who traverse the skies of our woodlands and mountains in search of fatty fish, rodents, or reptiles to keep them well-fed. Eagles have wingspans as tall as any humanoid, often reaching upwards of six and a half to seven feet long! It is with these powerful wings and their keen vision that an eagle can surprise its prey from soaring heights, giving the avian the element of surprise on unsuspecting prey. I myself have witnessed an eagle swoop down from on high and scoop up a noble woman’s small pet terrier, wrenching the yowling canine from the lady’s grasp before fading away into the afternoon skies. Truly these birds are powerful specimens!</p>\n<p><strong>Touch the Sky.</strong> The eagle prefers solitude when it can find it. The birds nest in homemade eyries, or nests, high above the world on mountain cliff faces. Here in the eyrie, the eagles lay their clutch of two eggs and raise a tiny, insular family with the female (and often much larger) chick taking dominance over any male born into the clan. The chicks grow under the care of their parents, being fed on a diet of regurgitated food until they are large enough to learn how to fly on their own. At this point, baby eagles are shunned from the nest and forced out into the world to fend for themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Lone Ranger.</strong> Eagles make fine companions for those who understand that these birds of prey are no mere pet, but an equal ally in their adventurers. Rangers seem particularly fond of the eagle as a hunting partner, as the birds may roam far and wide during a hunt and bring their master back any spoils they’ve found on their quest. This specialized form of modern falconry utilizes the eagles as trackers as well, as the eagle may spot prey from a great distance, then return to their master and guide them towards the quarry.

Frogs live a primary amount of their lives in and around sources of water which makes them common to swamps, marshes, and bogs. This, of course, is necessary as without a nearby source of water the frog’s slick skin would dry out and kill the frog. Insect eaters by nature, the frog utilizes its long, sticky tongue to capture all manner of insects (Author’s Note: In the swamps of the south, eye witnesses have sworn to have seen a frog species large enough that they ate small birds plucked right from the air!). Frogs have a unique manner of locomotion as their hind legs are far longer and folded in comparison to their front appendages. This unique evolution allows the frog to hop about and make quite fantastic jumps when fully extending its hind legs.</p>\n<p><strong>Tadpole evolved into Frog.</strong> Frogs begin their lives as nothing more than a jelly-like egg the size of a pinky nail. Upon hatching, the tiny frogs now in their tadpole state resemble miniature living comets, being hardly more than a ovular head and long swishing tail to propel themselves through the water. Over the course of several weeks the baby frogs develop limbs and fully evolve into their more recognizable adult form. Truly a fascinating process of development most often seen in insect species that our researchers have dubbed “metamorphosis”. What other creatures of our ever changing world could possess such a fantastic transformation as the common frog?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary

Known the world over for their large back humps (varying in number between one or two humps depending on species), camels have become an integral part of desert life due to their rugged albeit stubborn nature, nutritious meat and milk, and transportation utility. Camels have been domesticated for millennia. Highly sought after for their ability to survive within the harshest of deserts, the earliest records of camels in our world show them as domestic pack animals (much as they are utilized today) carrying heavy cargo across sandy expanses of inhospitable desert. The noble camel, however, may hold more secrets than its surface reveals.</p>\n<p><strong>Watch Out, They Spit.</strong> When asking a commoner about the camel’s most unique feature they will undoubtedly tell you that it is the fleshy humps upon the camel’s tall back. Commonly, these humps were thought to hold a reservoir of fresh water so the camel may survive the sandy dunes of its homeland; this is, however, not the case at all. Dissection of the dromedary beast has shown researchers that these humps are actually composed of fatty tissue which have collected into the humps as to not overheat the beast by being spread across the body. Camels, in fact, need only drink once every ten-day as their insulated coat keeps them at an adequate temperature and they absorb sufficient water vapor through exhaling via the nostrils. Camels also have a leathery mouth-lining allowing the herbivores to chew and swallow even the thorniest of cacti should they require water in such a fashion. Should you be in the desert and in need of a sturdy beast, adventurer, why not invest your gold into the camel? Just be mindful, they enjoy spitting on those they do not trust!</p>","public":""},"alignment":"Unaligned","race":null,"type":"Beast","environment":"Desert","cr":0.125,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":25},"source":"MM pg. 320","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"lg","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13,"prof":0,"total":3},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"ZSWBRlk2vsD2qKZC","sort":0,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/Camel.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Camel","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/Camel.png","tint":null,"width":2,"height":2,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"FQMFuzzSh73d0Nrd","actorLink":false,"disposition":0,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"XY89jRSGIvqLmLmw","name":"Bite","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+5 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one target.

Seahorses sport a narrow, long body ending in a curled tail with which they cling to sea plants. The seahorse’s head is long and narrow (resembling its land-dwelling namesake) tipped with a flute-like nose. Seahorses lack many of the supportive fins in comparison to other sea creatures, rather they have one long fin along their spine and two miniscule fins on opposite sides of their torsos which allow the tiny creatures to propel themselves through the water. Unfortunately these docile creatures do not make the best familiar choices as they only inhabit tropical, shallow waters to utilize the cover of corals for protection. Seahorses should be observed and enjoyed, but I would advise endangering your familiar by placing it into this beautiful little form.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Unaligned","race":null,"type":"Beast","environment":null,"cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg. 337","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"tiny","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"rjehyX85FDoydEwV","sort":700000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/SeaHorse.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Sea Horse","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/SeaHorse.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"FWSDiq9SZsdiBAa8","actorLink":false,"disposition":0,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"PBYkvhJmi5ACi2MO","name":"Water Breathing","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The sea horse can breathe only underwater.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"attunement":0},"sort":100000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/water_05.jpg","effects":[]}],"effects":[]}

Nobles can run the gamut of humanoid races, so long as these folks have the wealth to back up their claim to a noble title. Not all nobles are born into wealth however; in rare cases nobles may earn their status by dedicated work to the lords of their regions or by simply having titles given to them via friends finding themselves in positions of power. Through all of the perfume and powders adorning a noble's body, no stink is so ever present as that of corruption wafting just below the flowery mask.</p>\n<p><strong>Entourage.</strong> Nobles rarely travel alone outside of their massive estates, prefering to be flanked by a retinue of trained bodyguards and faithful servants. This should always be kept in mind when dealing with nobles; there is never simply the nobleman/woman alone beyond their estate walls. Should a brigand be fearsome enough to make it through the noble's well-paid defenses, the monied elite is certainly a force to be reckoned with. Noble-birthed children receive some of the finest martial training in the land from an early age and are well equipped to strike back with sword or rapier. Keep an eye on your own footwork should you misstep and leave yourself open to a noble's well practiced parry. Be mindful of whom you may approach in a fight, as a noble has so much more to offer than their warm blood spilt carelessly upon the earth.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any Alignment","race":null,"type":"Humanoid (any race)","environment":null,"cr":0.125,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":25},"source":"MM pg. 348","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"any two languages"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":15,"prof":2,"total":5},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ins":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":14,"prof":2,"total":4},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13,"prof":0,"total":3},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13,"prof":0,"total":3},"per":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":15,"prof":2,"total":5},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"8kEIcpvnYCYQJ2sV","sort":300000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/NobleSwordM.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Noble","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/NobleSwordM.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"GlaCGcgIP6YjBjGc","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"87olpriernjyGLbC","name":"Breastplate","type":"equipment","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather.

These slithering, scuttling arthropods are nearly the size of a small dog with sharpened mandibles measuring several inches in length at the tip of their head.&nbsp; Much like the average centipede, these creatures bear the multitude of slinking legs flanking both sides of its tubular body and seethe with the aggression of a wild boar.&nbsp; Giant centipedes think little beyond their next meal and will attack nearly any creature who enter into their territory, lashing out with their crushing mandibles capable of breaking through leather armor with ease.&nbsp; Once the centipede has successfully gripped its victim with its pinching mandibles, it delivers a potent poison into its target’s blood stream which (in rare cases) may act as a minor paralytic should the creature fall unconscious while poisoned.&nbsp;

These four legged friends are of course familiar to all whom read this tome and can come in thousands of various breeds and sizes. What makes these little reptiles so very unique (and possibly a fine form for your familiar) is their ability to cling to a multitude of surfaces. Adept at climbing, lizards may scale sheer surfaces and procure hidden vantage points from which to gaze down upon those you may wish to observe. Some varieties of lizards are also able to shift the pigmentation of their flesh, allowing for further subterfuge options! However, the humble lizard does not provide much in the way of offense as their bite is nothing more than a nuisance to most humanoids.

Primarily land-bound mammals, a baboon will use its powerful upper body to scamper up into a tree with alarming speed. Do not be misled by the size of this creature; a single woodland baboon can easily prove more vicious than an entire pack of hungry wolves. At first glance a baboon may appear an easy target for unwary adventurers as they are only three to four feet in length, weighing up to forty pounds per recent recordings. No larger than a healthy human child. This, however, is merely deception as the forest monkeys can easily overpower a group of unprepared travelers. Hidden within their dog-like muzzles are deadly sharp canines and behind their eyes is a shockingly intelligent mind.</p>\n<p><strong>Tooth Troop.</strong> Baboons are at their strongest when surrounded by their troop where they employ simplistic pack tactics to take down their foes. The monkeys have been observed skulking through tall grasses to set an ambush for unsuspecting prey or banding together to single out and mercilessly maul specific targets before moving to the next. Troops are governed by a single alpha who acts as the primary guardian of their fellows. Beneath the alpha, the troop works collaboratively, sharing food and resources between each other and engaging in communal grooming sessions to strengthen their bonds. Baboon young are raised in small family groups, being instructed by multiple adults at a time. A truly fascinating community and unique to our animal kingdom, baboons should be given a wide berth and travelers should cautiously handle an unexpected meeting by a local troop should your paths cross.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Unaligned","race":null,"type":"Beast","environment":"Forest","cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg. 318","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"sm","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"NBkyFFhtTwdmFhsp","sort":0,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/BaboonBlack.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Baboon","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/BaboonBlack.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":0.8,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"JW8bXggOMBx1S6tF","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"yb6o6KfKlg9bGhqA","name":"Pack Tactics","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The baboon has<strong> advantage </strong>on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the baboon's allies is within <strong>5 ft.</strong> of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":"","value":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell","value":""},"requirements":"Baboon","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"attunement":0},"sort":100000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/yellow_04.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"EXVZptAEHLscbODF","name":"Bite","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+1 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one target.

Though many modern researchers do not abide by this tale, it is rumored that Merfolk evolved from a colony of humans whose city sank below the waves in a catastrophic accident. The Merfolk themselves, however, choose neither to confirm or deny this tale. Very basically, Merfolk resemble an average humanoid with a few key differences. Where one would expect to find legs beneath the torso of a human, they would instead find the powerful tail of a relatively sized fish. Merfolk also have frilled gills adorning their necks allowing them to breathe the salty waters of the ocean's depths. Several additional fins grace the Merfolk's lithe body about the biceps and hips. Upon the Merfolk's humanoid head rests a single, large frill webbed by translucent skin which may raise or fold back depending on the Merfolk's mood.</p>\n<p><strong>Murmaider.</strong> Merfolk live along the coastal waters of continental shelves, rarely allowing themselves to drift down into the darker depths of the ocean's abyss. Here in the more shallow tides, the Merfolk build their homes into thriving coral reefs, labyrinthian undersea caverns, and even the hollowed out remains of once coastal cities or sunken vessels. Anywhere shrouded from the view of prying land-dwellers makes the perfect home for a Merfolk. The Merfolk's reclusiveness is so well known, that mariners would tell fanciful tales of meeting a Merfolk for a midnight tryst, only to be abandoned at sunrise by the elusive creature. Most of the mariner's fellows would shove the notion aside, having never seen a living or dead Merfolk in all their years at sea. This is not to say that Merfolk will flee from intruders should an unfortunate landlubber find their way into a Merfolk's abode. Armed with spears of sharpened coral and powerful webbed hands ending in dagger-like barbs the Merfolk are well equipped to defend themselves within their aquatic homes.

The ebony feathered bird reaches height of nearly two and a half feet tall and bears a thick, dark beak which is perfectly utilized in its scavenging diet of carrion, unattended grains, and insects. However, something truly special lurks behind the dark abyss of this bird’s eyes. Should you be prepared, adventurer, the effort put into training the raven will be given back tenfold.</p>\n<p><strong>Musings and Mimicry.</strong> Ravens are unique specimens among birds; by listening intently and practicing often the raven is able to mimic sounds it hears perfectly. From noises of forest animals to the precise timbre of their master’s call, ravens are among the most seamless mimics to be found in the animal kingdom. Truly adventurer, the possibilities to employ the raven’s mimicry are nearly limitless! You may see another example of this perfect mimicry in a larger cousin to this bird as well: the humanoid Kenku. Raven-like in form these little humanoids share the feathers and large beaks of their brethren, as well as their ability to copy the sounds of the world around them. Consider a second listen when you hear a voice but cannot place its location, for perhaps the raven speaks from the rafters above you, upon a midnight dreary.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Unaligned","race":null,"type":"Beast","environment":"Swamp","cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg. 335","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"tiny","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":13,"prof":2,"total":3},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"RSebJT8R6qUqPs4A","sort":200000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/Raven.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Raven","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/Raven.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":0.8,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"LPdX5YLlwci0NDZx","actorLink":false,"disposition":0,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"nDvgtu7NSNCrREAv","name":"Mimicry","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The raven can mimic simple sounds it has heard, such as a person whispering, a baby crying, or an animal chittering.

Sprites are tiny humanoids held aloft by a pair of dragonfly’s wings who inhabit glades dappled with mushrooms, wild flowers, and occasionally fellow fey creatures such a living trees whom allow the Sprites to construct villages within their ample boughs.&nbsp; Here in the bosom of nature’s serenity the Sprites exist with one purpose: protect their home at all costs.&nbsp; Unlike their Pixie kin, Sprites are fearsome warriors and adept poison crafters willing to lay down their lives to protect their glade.&nbsp; Should an intruder enter into their territory, the Sprites will take to the trees and bushes causing all manner of racket in an attempt to scare off the intruder without conflict.&nbsp; If the intruder remains, they will dart out and surround the invader, filling it with poison tipped arrows.&nbsp; The poison is not deadly, rather, it renders the victim unconscious so the Sprites may flee to a safer location within the forest.</p>\n<p><strong>Closer to the Heart.</strong> While Sprites make fearsome warriors, they are not without reason in analyzing their enemies.&nbsp; Upon rendering a creature unconscious, the Sprite can touch the creature and learn the true nature of the creature’s heart, be they good or evil, by “seeing” their heart.&nbsp; As the heart never lies, the Sprite can make keen judgements about the creature’s intentions and determine if they are truly a threat using this “heart sight”.&nbsp; In some instances, Sprites have been known to ally themselves with good natured creatures, especially if that creature has come to topple an evil-aligned fey creature in their forest home.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Neutral Good","race":null,"type":"Fey","environment":"Forest","cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"MM pg. 283","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"tiny","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","elvish","sylvan"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14,"prof":0,"total":4},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":13,"prof":2,"total":3},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14,"prof":0,"total":4},"ste":{"value":2,"ability":"dex","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":18,"prof":4,"total":8},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"rjehyX85FDoydEwV","sort":1600000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/fey/Sprite.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Sprite","displayName":0,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/fey/Sprite.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"MUpBNDoJEr09bLaO","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{},"bar2":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"qlTIjSkjmEDQTj1x","name":"Leather Armor (tiny)","type":"equipment","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil.

Jackals are closely related to coyotes, the two species commonly hunt and travel through similar territories causing confusion among untrained researchers. Often a bright golden to light beige tone, the jackal’s fur is marked with notable black stirpes which run horizontally in thick bands across the beasts’ bodies. Jackals have a unique social structure among canids as they most often shirk life with a pack in favor of finding a singular, monogamous mate with whom they remain in a wide territory. This is not to say that some jackals do not form packs; however, it will be more common in your travels to spot a bachelor or breeding pair rather than a whole cluster of these beasts. Much like the savannah’s hyenas, the jackal does not escape the skeptical eye of the trained adventurer as the warning sign of evil upon the horizon. Gifted sentience and the ability of shape-changing by the Demon Lord Graz’zt, newly created beasts dubbed Jackalweres resemble humanoid jackals in their hybrid forms. Now bound to the Demon Lord, the Jackalwere assumes the life of a slaver, plucking unsuspecting humanoids from their comfortable lives by rendering them helpless under the Jackalwere’s magical, sleep inducing gaze. Beware young adventurers, for the small jackal you see feasting upon carrion by the road’s edge may be the servant of a demonic overlord in magical disguise.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by

In much the same way that an animated skeleton is returned from the dead so too are zombies shunted back into this world.&nbsp; While a skilled spellcaster may animate the dead and command the newly awakened, zombies may also rise in areas of the world saturated with necromantic energy.&nbsp; In this situation, the zombies will not obey the command of a master, but roam aimlessly in a small area until they either find something to attack and consume or rot away into a pile of inanimate bones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Re: Your Brains.</strong> Zombies do retain quite a lot of their former selves in regards to their physical appearance.&nbsp; Zombies will still show the wounds or disease scars which slew them upon reanimating.&nbsp; The symptoms of decay will also be present as many freshly spawned zombies will be bloated, have patches of skin sloughing from their bodies, or even trailing entrails from exploded abdomens.&nbsp; While a zombie may resemble the person they were before, there is nothing at work within the head except mindless hunger.&nbsp; Zombies stumble through their existence in a perpetual state of mindlessness only able to heed their master&rsquo;s orders.&nbsp; This fact of the zombie&rsquo;s mind makes them invaluable warriors for a necromancer in need.&nbsp; Zombies are direct and will shamble off towards their quarry without so much as a second thought to their own safety.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been noted that some zombies have walked through fires or pits of acid in order to reach their enemies.&nbsp; Once they reach their target, zombies will pummel and bite at their enemy until either they or the enemy fall in the tussle.&nbsp; Zombies may also wield weapons, though not cleverly; zombies will not be able to reclaim a weapon should they be disarmed as the lack of weapon will simply drive them to claw with their broken hands.&nbsp; The magic which binds the zombie to the mortal plane is tricky to the uninitiated as well, so please be warned young adventurers!&nbsp; Should you fell a zombie, be aware that the creature may not be fully dead for the second time; you should always be sure to wait and see if the beast attempts to rise once more before wandering deeper into the dungeon.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Neutral Evil","race":null,"type":"Undead","environment":"Urban","cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"MM pg. 316","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":["poison"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["poisoned"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"understands the languages it knew in life but can't speak"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"KfEs7N8n2rnnVvlr","sort":0,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/undead/Zombie.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Zombie","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/undead/Zombie.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":60,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"NAISFPoNNgUCsEyW","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"Ed7XgnZu9qRs3qdn","name":"Slam","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\"><p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+3 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one target.

It should be clear that for all identification purposes, ponies are not young horses. Ponies are classified by the naturalists of our lands as any horse who is under a height of 14 hands total. Thus, ponies are simply nothing more than small horses. Ponies often make treasured gifts to the children of upper class society as they are prized for their beauty and calm demeanor.

Bats are a nocturnal creature prized by arcanists for their ability to navigate terrain in near total darkness.&nbsp; This alone makes them a prized choice for a summoned familiar.&nbsp; Varying from the size of a mouse to that of a house cat, bats have a unique feature amongst mammals: the gift of flight!&nbsp; Stretched thin between needle-thin boney “hands” are fleshy membranes which span out wide from the bat’s delicate body, allowing the bats to take to the skies in search of insects and woodland fruits to indulge upon.</p>\n<p><strong>Chitter Chatter.</strong> Presumed blind by many from nonsense tales told to children, bats have eyesight nearly akin to our own, though notably less sharp.&nbsp; What makes these creatures truly unique is their ability to navigate in the pitch black of night.&nbsp; The bats utilize a series of chirps and screeches researchers have dubbed “echolocation” to pinpoint objects or prey within their flightpath.&nbsp; The echolocation chirps emitted by the bats bounce back towards the tiny creature’s proportionally massive ears, allowing the bats to make split second corrections to their navigations without the aid of their eyes.&nbsp; It should be again noted that the bat makes a clever familiar choice, as they may navigate those places too dim and dangerous for our mortal eyes</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Unaligned","race":null,"type":"Beast","environment":null,"cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"Swarm","class":{},"size":"med"},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":["bludgeoning","piercing","slashing"],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["charmed","frightened","grappled","paralyzed","petrified","prone","restrained","stunned"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"rjehyX85FDoydEwV","sort":2300000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/SwarmBats.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Swarm of Bats","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/SwarmBats.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1.25,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":45,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":60,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"PcZ0QjIG6bHpffp9","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"0NpX1YUDTXjgIm23","name":"Bites","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+4 to hit,</strong>, <strong>0 ft.,</strong> one creature in the swarm's space.

Almost a carbon copy of the ground-dwelling common snakes, the flying snake has simply evolved wings by some uncanny biological need or magical meddling. These thin, membrane lined wings allow the snake to clumsily glide through the air, avoiding the clutter of the jungle floor with ease. Brightly colored with glittering veridian scales, these flying serpents are truly beautiful to behold as they glide, lithe and swooping, through the canopy of vines and dense foliage. The thin little windmasters have often found themselves in the service of jungle cultists or tribal magic wielders. With some coaxing and gentle attempts at domestication, the owner may be rewarded with a unique and uncannily loyal ally to curl about their forearm on any number of adventures.

Hailing from grassy plains to thick and sweltering jungles, the Axe Beak resembles the flightless emu in both size and appearance.&nbsp; The Axe Beak sports a rounded, plump body resting upon two powerful legs built for running and kicking at high speeds.&nbsp; From the body sprouts a long and graceful neck ending in an unfeathered head tipped with a sharp, wedge-shaped beak.&nbsp; This beak (reminiscent of a hatchet) is what gives the creature its fearsome name.</p>\n<p><strong>Let Me Axe You a Question.</strong> Axe Beaks have been studied for quite some time, as their flightless footsteps have been tracked for thousands of years by biologists.&nbsp; An ancient and relatively unchanged species, the Axe Beak is most notable (aside from the beak) for its temper.&nbsp; Axe Beaks are incredibly territorial animals and have been known to chase down intruders within their territory for miles before finally calling off the attack.&nbsp; Shockingly, some Axe Beaks have been domesticated through rigorous, consistent interaction with humanoids.&nbsp; These beasts may act as riding animals and are powerful enough to support a fully grown Orc warrior.&nbsp; During battle, should one be unfortunate enough to cross the bird, the Axe Beak will swing its powerful neck in a chopping arc to bring its sharpened beak down upon any unfortunate foe.&nbsp; Should their beak (which has been known to sever limbs and pierce plate armor) not be enough, the Axe Beak may turn and deliver a devastating kick with one of its powerful, clawed feet.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Unaligned","race":null,"type":"Beast","environment":"Grassland","cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"MM pg. 317","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"lg","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"6DauPtHPdkuwtDcK","sort":3000000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/AxeBeak.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Axe Beak","displayName":0,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/AxeBeak.png","tint":null,"width":2,"height":2,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"SXXvwaLBNuzBymp3","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"FsSMPLEC46UKCf7T","name":"Beak","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+4 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one target.

ability to navigate terrain in near total darkness.&nbsp; This alone makes them a prized choice for a summoned familiar.&nbsp; Varying from the size of a mouse to that of a house cat, bats have a unique feature amongst mammals: the gift of flight!&nbsp; Stretched thin between needle-thin boney “hands” are fleshy membranes which span out wide from the bat’s delicate body, allowing the bats to take to the skies in search of insects and woodland fruits to indulge upon.</p>\n<p><strong>Chitter Chatter.</strong> Presumed blind by many from nonsense tales told to children, bats have eyesight nearly akin to our own, though notably less sharp.&nbsp; What makes these creatures truly unique is their ability to navigate in the pitch black of night.&nbsp; The bats utilize a series of chirps and screeches researchers have dubbed “echolocation” to pinpoint objects or prey within their flightpath.&nbsp; The echolocation chirps emitted by the bats bounce back towards the tiny creature’s proportionally massive ears, allowing the bats to make split second corrections to their navigations without the aid of their eyes.&nbsp; It should be again noted that the bat makes a clever familiar choice, as they may navigate those places too dim and dangerous for our mortal eyes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope

Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world.

They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware.

They attacked from out of the bushes like a tidal wave of bodies crashing into our cart, all the while gibbering in their foul, snarl of a tongue.&nbsp; We should have been prepared for them, I recall their weaponry was so poor one bugger was swinging half a broom handle with a small iron spike driven through; nonetheless, they overwhelmed us with their surprise attack and made off with a hefty share of the camp’s rations for the next month.<br><em>Captain Will Freidmont of the Upper Wilds Valdyrguard.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Goblins are evil creatures of diminutive stature who exist in almost every corner of the natural world as a constant yet generally manageable threat.&nbsp; Hailing from a group of creatures called goblinoids (which includes bugbears and hobgoblins), the goblin is a foul humanoid measuring no larger than the average halfling.&nbsp; Goblins have skin tones varying from light clay to deep chestnut brown to a sickly, acidic green, their hair is thin and greasy, and within their jaws rest cracked and sharpened teeth.&nbsp; Together with their foaming fellows, goblins form loose collectives or tribes so their power can stand pronounced in numbers.&nbsp; The tribal life also allows for a crude caste system to erupt from the goblin’s chaotic politics.&nbsp; All goblins have something to offer to the tribe, be they foragers, slavers, or warriors.&nbsp; If they cannot contribute, they die.</p>\n<p><strong>We Live in a Society.&nbsp;</strong> Capricious to the last, goblins crave nothing more than power and domination of all others around them by any means (including those methods dangerous to the goblin).&nbsp; Those goblins who possess enough might or cleverness may ascend to the rank of Goblin Boss and command a lair consisting of several dozens goblinoid fellows.&nbsp; Should ambition prove overwhelming, the boss in rare cases may subjugate nearby lairs of rival goblinoids and crown themselves a Goblin Queen/King.&nbsp; It has been documented that in one particular case, Queen Greld the Gutripper was able to enslave a camp containing hundreds of orcs, then laid siege to the city of Westerholt close by and sacked the entire city.</p>\n<p><strong>Gnash and Bite, Trick and Trap.</strong> Goblins maintain some of the most chaotic lairs within the known world, and to accomplish this the goblins require a plethora of slaves.&nbsp; Not always willing to murder those they plunder, goblins and their kin are known slavers, spiriting away captured humans from merchant wagons to contruct their insidious dungeons.&nbsp; WIthin a goblin lair is all manner of trap: tunnels leading nowhere, narrow passages no human could pass through, arrow slits, pits lined with spikes, and of course a multitude of alarms to warn the tribe of any impending danger.&nbsp; Goblins utilize chaotic placement within their lairs to throw off intruders from their hard earned loot which is kept safe within the lair’s heart.</p>\n<p><strong>And They Dance About the Flames.</strong> Goblins, though commonly thought of as greedy and stupid, leave their chaotic tendancies behind when it comes to the structure of religious worship.&nbsp; They are beholden in particular to The God of the Goblins, also called They Who Lurk Beneath, who acts as chief of all other gods to the goblinoids.&nbsp; This god encourages acts of violence, blind cruelty, enslaving others, as well as war amongst the enemies of the goblins.&nbsp; Goblin tribes will join together in times of worship to dance, perform rituals with blood and bone, build massive bonfires, and sew chaos throughout the lair all in devotion to their evil benefactor.&nbsp; Goblins, fueled by the spirit of the revelry, will then be exceedingly aggressive and volatile for the days after, raging through the surrounding area to sate the thirst of their cruel god.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Neutral Evil","race":null,"type":"Humanoid (goblinoid)","environment":"Underdark","cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"MM pg. 166","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"sm","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","goblin"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ste":{"value":2,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":16,"prof":4,"total":6},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"kdTgTyvlimxTW5xZ","sort":3900000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/Goblin.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Goblin","displayName":0,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/Goblin.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":60,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"TjWQOgI3A4UAl7lC","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{},"bar2":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"Ti3XQOmTKdgcnpAa","name":"Leather Armor","type":"equipment","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil.

The beast is thick about its tubular body, the entire length rimmed with bands of muscle strong enough to suffocate a fully grown deer.&nbsp; With a stout, club-shaped head and probing tongue, the constrictor snake shimmies ever-so stealthily towards its quarry.&nbsp; Setting its dulled vision upon the rodent, the snake tastes the air with its forked tongue and pinpoints the rat’s position.&nbsp; The hunt is over in a flash: striking like an arrow loosed from a bow, the snake sinks its needle-like fangs into the rat’s body before winding coil after coil of its body tightly around the rodent’s chest so it can crush and squeeze the last breath from the tiny beast’s body.&nbsp; In a single, ugly gulp, the rat disappears into the snake.&nbsp; Constrictor snakes inhabit, primarily, the jungles of the world and utilize their clever camouflage flecked scales to blend into the surrounding foliage.&nbsp; Unlike their more venomous cousins, these snakes do not bear the hollow fangs to deliver a deadly dose of neurotoxin; rather, these snakes rely on their brute strength to strangle the life out of their victims.&nbsp; While most constrictors are no threat to the average humanoid, there are some species large enough to consume a fully grown pony.&nbsp; Beware the waters and thick brush of the jungle floor as this is where these deadly beasts prefer to hide.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Unaligned","race":null,"type":"Beast","environment":"Underwater","cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"MM pg. 320","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"lg","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"ZSWBRlk2vsD2qKZC","sort":1200000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/ConstrictorSnake.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Constrictor Snake","displayName":0,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/ConstrictorSnake.png","tint":null,"width":2,"height":2,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":10,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"UTuKdTah1DKfPwWe","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"hZOM2L6WMmk8QOfO","name":"Bite","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+4 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one creature.

To the steam mephit, however, this is a paradise.&nbsp; Steam mephits are skilled in very minor magics used to aid them in their tenuous existence on the plane of steam.&nbsp; The mephit is also able to unleash a small jet of superheated steam from its mouth to scald its enemies should it need to.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Neutral Evil","race":null,"type":"Elemental","environment":"Underwater","cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"MM pg. 217","class":{},"size":"med"},"traits":{"size":"sm","di":{"value":["fire","poison"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["poisoned"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["aquan","ignan"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"rjehyX85FDoydEwV","sort":1800000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/elemental/SteamMephit.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Steam Mephit","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/elemental/SteamMephit.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"UthHOT7QfZfEIUue","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"hCVZYfHL0FDQvVK7","name":"Blur","type":"spell","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Your body becomes blurred, shifting and wavering to all who can see you.

The offspring of a horse and donkey, the now sterile, stubborn mule provides a plentiful sum of benefits from both of its progenitors. Mules can be difficult to tell apart from the common donkey; however, they are easily identified by several features: Mules are taller on average than a donkey with a flatter spine and shorter ears in comparison to a donkey's notoriously floppy ears. Something they retain from their parents is their surefooted nature, allowing mules to pass through difficult terrain such as muddy trails and rocky outcrops with more ease than other beasts. Beware the ass-end of this quiet creature, however, as mules have a mighty kick which they can deliver at force behind themselves much like a horse. Mules make excellent beasts of burden for the traveling merchant or road-bound adventuring party who needs an extra hoof or four to carry along their well-earned spoils.

Weasels are tiny, long bodied mammals reaching approximately eight inches in length and bearing coat colorations ranging from chestnut brown to pale white. The weasel’s long body allows it to easily wedge itself into a rodent’s burrow and pull the critter out for a tasty meal. Weasels make quite effective pest controllers in their territories as they eat multitudes of rodents annually. These little cleaners are, however, often considered to be pests in their own right; farmers across the countryside report that their poultry is killed or stolen away by sneaky weasels making their way into their chicken coops. While not the most deadly mammal in the world, the weasel does pack a nasty, sharp-toothed bite.

Cousin to the common spider, a scorpion bears nearly no resemblance to the web-spinner beyond its eight legs. Scorpions host a segmented body that culminates in a long, knob-ended tail bearing a needle-like stinger upon its end. This stinger bears a venomous toxin which can range from mildly irritating to direly deadly depending upon the species. At the other end of the scorpion’s body lay two crab-like claws that aid it in gripping prey while the scorpion’s venom works through the unfortunate insect’s body.</p>\n<p><strong>Chitin and Hate.</strong> Scorpions may live in a variety of environments, but they are most numerous in deserts and dusty plains. These little arachnids find solace from the harsh rays of the sun within scrub brush, under rocks, and within stolen burrows deep below the earth. From these nestled hideouts the scorpion can quickly lash out at any unsuspecting morsel who wanders into their domain. Make doubly sure to carry an antitoxin in your pack when venturing out into the desert, adventurer, for within a hero’s sturdy boots is one of the scorpion’s favorite places to hide.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Unaligned","race":null,"type":"Beast","environment":"Desert","cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg. 337","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"tiny","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"rjehyX85FDoydEwV","sort":3200000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/ScorpionSand.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Scorpion","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/ScorpionSand.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":0.8,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":10,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"Y0vxQVF7w2P38FK2","actorLink":false,"disposition":0,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"ltue5DUb1SZfphHE","name":"Sting","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+2 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one creature.

Standing tall with a soft, tan coat, Mastiffs are often identified by their wrinkled and jowly face, the jaws of which are constantly oozing a steady stream of hot drool. Mastiffs are intelligent companions who can be trained from an early age as guard and hunting animals. Armed with stout jaws lined with deadly sharp teeth, a Mastiff is certainly a worthy challenge for any bandit who dares to run afoul the dog's Master. I have even observed these dogs working as beasts of burden and comfortable mounts for the smaller folk (halflings and gnomes) of the countryside. Here, the Mastiff replaces the horse in such duties as pulling carts, working as plow animals, and delivering parcels as swift courier beasts. Should you need a companion not bent towards droning conversation, perhaps indulge in a Mastiff to keep you company upon the lonely roads of our world.

Though giant in only the relative sense to their non-illuminated cousins, the Giant Fire Beetle typically spans the width of an adult human’s hand. These tiny, docile titans content themselves in scuttling through darkened places such as caverns, catacombs, and mossy overgrowths in search of scraps to eat or a quiet, damp place in which to make their burrows.</p>\n<p><strong>Of Darkness and Light.</strong> Curiously enough, due to the species evolving without the natural light of our sun, the poor creature is completely blind. The Giant Fire Beetle, however, is not totally without senses. Using specialized antenna, these hardy insects are able to “see” the world around them within a slightly limited ranged. The true prize (as so many fledgling adventurers boast) is the orange bioluminescent glands located beneath either side of their mandibles and to the very rear of their abdomen. These firey hued glands are packed with a symbiotic, glowing fungus, which will continue to glow for up to one week once disconnected from their host! Some clever adventurers have taken to capturing live beetles, placing them within empty lanterns to light their way in remote caverns for even longer periods of time.</p>\n<p><strong>In Last Resort.</strong> Most often a peaceful insect, Giant Fire Beetles have been observed defending food in times of great hunger; the creatures will rarely flee a tasty morsel should they feel a threat to their meal is near. The Giant Fire Beetle does pack a nasty bite with its sharpened mandibles that may pierce even the toughest boiled leather armor should it feel threatened enough to attack. Take heed when approaching a swarm of these insects lest you suffer some nasty lacerations.

These squirrel sized companions are molded out of wads of clay and given life through a rare ritual taught to more experienced spellcasters. The homunculi have the extraordinary ability to experience the thoughts and senses of their master as the two share a special telepathic bond that may only be broken in death of if one of the parties ventures to a separate plane of existence. The homunculus is also gifted a language upon awakening and may act as a servant, spy, or even simple messenger for their master. It is not at all uncommon to see those in possession of a homunculus to utilize them in completing simple chores about their abodes so the spellcaster may focus on more tedious tasks. An odd caveat of this homunculus ritual is that the spellcaster may only be in possession of one clay companion at a time; should the caster attempt to create a new homunculus the process with always fail.

Please note that “Giant” is a relative term and this creature is only giant in relative terms to its common size.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Snakes rank among the most plentiful and diverse reptiles to slither across our planet’s surface.&nbsp; Resembling nothing more than a scaly worm at first look, snakes are actually highly developed predators who slither across the ground in order to stealthily hunt their prey of smaller reptiles, rodents, and birds.&nbsp; Though there are many species of snake, we will only discuss the poisonous varieties within this article.&nbsp; Poisonous snakes bear a marked identifier separating them from their nonpoisonous brethren: the shape of their pupils.&nbsp; While snakes lacking venom glands have rounded pupils, those snakes with a venomous bite have slitted pupils much like those of a common domestic cat.&nbsp; The devious snake, however, has so much more beneath its scaly surface.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t Tread on Me.</strong>&nbsp; Ever camouflaged both by their similarities to roots, sticks, or branches as well as the marvelous patterns of black, browns, greens, and tans speckling their hides, snakes are masters of blending into their surroundings.&nbsp; Even perched on a rock to warm their bodies in the heat of the sun, snakes can certainly be missed by just a passing glance.&nbsp; While the creature’s eyesight is relatively poor, snakes have adapted an amazing ability to sense the world around them.&nbsp; Snakes “smell” with their tongues!&nbsp; Yes, by flicking their tongues out of their mouths with a fascinating flourish, these reptiles are able to smell prey or predators in their environment by collecting the miniscule scents on their tongues.&nbsp; Within the snake’s mouth lies its most deadly asset in the form of two, hollow fangs.&nbsp; Snakes prefer to strike from the shadows, allowing their quiet method of travel to get them close enough to their prey to avoid a fight.&nbsp; The creature then lashes out in the blink of an eye, catching the unwary prey in their jaws while injecting them with a controlled dose of highly toxic venom through their hollow fangs.&nbsp; Then it’s only a matter of moments until the poor creature is left dead by the snake’s potent toxins.&nbsp; While the majority of snake species are not deadly to humanoids, caution is advised for those not well versed in identifying reptiles.&nbsp; Antidote should always be carried in areas known to house populations of poisonous snakes, just in case.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Unaligned","race":null,"type":"Beast","environment":"Underdark","cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"MM pg. 327","class":{},"size":"lg"},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14,"prof":0,"total":4},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14,"prof":0,"total":4},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14,"prof":0,"total":4},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"kdTgTyvlimxTW5xZ","sort":2300000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/GiantPoisonousSnake.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Giant Poisonous Snake","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/GiantPoisonousSnake.png","tint":null,"width":2,"height":2,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":10,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"ZW39DE2zI3TXVYC9","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"GlOJaYXJFUP0Hd80","name":"Bite","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+6 to hit,</strong>, <strong>10 ft.,</strong> one target.

Hyenas resemble a medium sized dog with a short, wide muzzle and overly long neck. Adorned with patterns of spots or stripes marking their fur, to the untrained eyes a hyena would appear to be nothing more than a wild dog; however, these curious creatures are more closely related to wildcats in their behavior with fellows. Hyenas communally groom unlike several wild dog species and display similar scent marking and mating patterns as other feliforms. These sorts of behaviors build a solid community within the hyenas’ pack, sowing tight knit bonds between the beasts.</p>\n<p><strong>Give Us a Smile.</strong> Hyenas display a unique characteristic in their vocalizations between the pack; instead of a yowl or bark as one would expect, the hyenas instead communicate via yips, chirps, and “laughs”. Each member of the pack has its own unique “laugh” which signals to the pack both their identity and current mood. These chittering “laughs” have given the hyena (regardless of species to commoners) the moniker of The Laughing Hyena. One should instead feel caution over joy should you hear the caterwauling yips of a hyena pack in the distance. These beasts are highly intelligent and when banded together and utilizing their preferred hunting patterns they may easily overtake a large mercantile caravan.</p>\n<p><strong>The Hungering Savagery.</strong> The hyena’s most sinister aspect is their relation to the Demon Lord of the Gnolls, Yeenoghu. Gnolls, of course, resemble massive humanoid hyenas brandishing bloody weapons and sowing destruction in their horrid wakes. Finding the hyena either useful or ironic, Gnolls will bring packs of slavering hyenas with them on raids into villages or leave the beasts (which they purposefully starve) at their dens to kill any unwary explorers.

Owls are medium-sized birds of prey with flat, disk shaped faces and large dark eyes. A sharp beak sits at the center of their ovular face, built for tearing the flesh of small rodents. As deadly as they are silent, owls are nocturnal beasts who hunt from the shadows of treetops, barn lofts, or simply high above in an open field. Owls are able to fly in near silence due to a set of specialized feathers along their wing-tops, giving them the ability to glide down and surprise an unsuspecting vole without ever being heard. Owls are not the most sociable creatures, preferring to keep to their roosts in solitude making them treasured by arcanists as the bird primarily sits quietly throughout the day, lost in sleep. Owls also have a unique vocalization among birds, emitting a mournful hoot-hoot sound rather than the typical songbird tweeting. Perhaps consider the owl should you be uninterested in sociable animals or if you wish to send messages in relative secrecy in the dead of night.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten

Spiders are arachnids with eight thin legs protruding from their dual-segmented body.&nbsp; Atop the spider’s tiny head are eight glistening eyes with which it views the world in relative obscurity.&nbsp; While the spider’s eyesight may be poor regardless of the number of eyes, they have a clever trick up their sleeves: the spider’s web!</p>\n<p><strong>Some Bug.</strong> Ingenious little architects, spiders produce a silken thread from their rears dubbed “webbing” which they use to construct elaborate homes.&nbsp; Resembling something of a net, the spider’s web serves a dual purpose: to capture food upon its sticky surface and to give the spider a safe place to perch away from predators.&nbsp; Once an insect is trapped within the web, the spider quickly wraps the unsuspecting creature in a bundle of webbing, saving its prize for later consumption.&nbsp; While all spiders are venomous in some capacity, many will not be harmful to the adventurer on their travels.&nbsp; Simply avoid webs where you see them and be quite sure that the web which you see only belongs to a standard spider species, as a plethora of gigantic and magical varieties also lurk within similar webs!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Unaligned","race":null,"type":"Beast","environment":"Grassland","cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"MM pg. 330","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13,"prof":0,"total":3},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":13,"prof":2,"total":3},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13,"prof":0,"total":3},"ste":{"value":2,"ability":"dex","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":17,"prof":4,"total":7},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"kdTgTyvlimxTW5xZ","sort":3400000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/GiantWolfSpider.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Giant Wolf Spider","displayName":0,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/GiantWolfSpider.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":60,"brightSight":10,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"f9JbhBfWucrY2eDA","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"w4oJusdFuSttyz8X","name":"Spider Climb","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":"","type":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":"","value":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell","value":""},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"attunement":0},"sort":100000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/green_23.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"Et0GP61ZnJkxxqvN","name":"Bite","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+3 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one creature.

The bird’s bald, featherless head and black body plumage lend it a sinister facade. The vulture’s outer appearance along with its penchant to scavenge carrion for sustenance has settled the bird squarely into the designation of “evil” in the eyes of many common-folk. The bird’s connection with death, as the vulture will circle a dead or dying creature from high above, also adds to the revulsion felt towards this markedly important creature.</p>\n<p><strong>By Committee.</strong> Vultures congregate in groups called “committees” or “wakes” on whether or not they are feasting together respectively. These groups squabble for scraps of meat, ripping away rotting flesh from a carcass with their sharp and powerful beaks. It is not uncommon for fights to break out between the hungry birds. Due to their desire to scavenge dead flesh, vultures play a vital role in our ecosystem, as they act as vital decomposers in landscapes where insects or fungi may not exist as readily. Be on the lookout for vultures in your travels, as they can be the sign of nature at work or perhaps something more sinister beneath the talons of this bird.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by

Another bird of prey, the hawk may be differentiated from eagle species by its smaller frame. Hawks on average weigh no more than eight pounds and have a wingspan of only five feet. These miniscule raptors bear dark brown to deep red plumage unlike the eagle’s most common golden hue. Several species of these birds of prey have been observed employing different tactics in their hunting patterns as well; while the mighty eagle soars down from on high and lifts its prey off into the air with it, hawks prefer to lurk in the cover of trees, waiting for the opportune time to swoop in and surprise their prey from the shadows. Due to their keen eyesight as well as their smaller profile, hawks have been utilized as messenger birds by desert cultures for centuries. Clever and loyal, the hawk may be an option for the adventurer who prefers a raptor who enjoys the cover of shadows and stealth to aid them in their hunts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Unaligned","race":null,"type":"Beast","environment":null,"cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg. 330","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"tiny","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13,"prof":0,"total":3},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":14,"prof":2,"total":4},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13,"prof":0,"total":3},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13,"prof":0,"total":3},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"DuRKNuzI99G8kWWa","sort":200000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/Hawk.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Hawk","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/Hawk.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":0.8,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"fnkPNfIpS62LqOu4","actorLink":false,"disposition":0,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"hHbY6NAFUWVlz7tj","name":"Keen Sight","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The eagle has<strong> advantage </strong>on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":"","type":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":"","value":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell","value":""},"requirements":"Hawk","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"attunement":0},"sort":100000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/blue_29.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"0Di3cqTRD7ot8ZCa","name":"Talons","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+5 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one target.

The ebony feathered bird reaches height of nearly two and a half feet tall and bears a thick, dark beak which is perfectly utilized in its scavenging diet of carrion, unattended grains, and insects.&nbsp; However, something truly special lurks behind the dark abyss of this bird’s eyes.&nbsp; Should you be prepared, adventurer, the effort put into training the raven will be given back tenfold.</p>\n<p><strong>Musings and Mimicry.&nbsp;</strong> Ravens are unique specimens among birds; by listening intently and practicing often the raven is able to mimic sounds it hears perfectly.&nbsp; From noises of forest animals to the precise timbre of their master’s call, ravens are among the most seamless mimics to be found in the animal kingdom.&nbsp; Truly adventurer, the possibilities to employ the raven’s mimicry are nearly limitless!&nbsp; You may see another example of this perfect mimicry in a larger cousin to this bird as well: the humanoid Kenku.&nbsp; Raven-like in form these little humanoids share the feathers and large beaks of their brethren, as well as their ability to copy the sounds of the world around them.&nbsp; Consider a second listen when you hear a voice but cannot place its location, for perhaps the raven speaks from the rafters above you, upon a midnight dreary.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Unaligned","race":null,"type":"Beast","environment":"Forest","cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"MM pg. 339","class":{},"size":"med"},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":["bludgeoning","piercing","slashing"],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["charmed","frightened","grappled","paralyzed","petrified","prone","restrained","stunned"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"prc":{"value":2,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":15,"prof":4,"total":5},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"rjehyX85FDoydEwV","sort":3000000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/SwarmRavens.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Swarm of Ravens","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/SwarmRavens.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"g40zN6xMye6bSS94","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"Vmmq0dqa2hEcTGOC","name":"Swarm","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny raven.

Stirges resemble nothing more than a slightly oversized bat crossed with a mosquito; however, upon closer inspection the Stirge reveals much more. Coated in greasy, pink flesh (save for a small tufted mane of white fur about its head and neck) the Stirge is equipped with a pair of small, bat-like wings made of stretched flesh between struts of thin bone. The skin here at the wing is so thin that light may easily shine through the beast's wings revealing the tiny vesicles within. Stirges also possess a set of six, spindly legs above their pig-like tail. Each leg is tipped with a set of hooked claws which allows the fiend to grip into the flesh of its prey and hang on should a struggle ensue. However, there is one more feature that makes the Stirge truly repugnant.</p>\n<p><strong>What's Your Type?</strong> Stirges are notable for their ravenous desire to consume the blood of living organisms. These beasts accomplish this foul act with aid from the needle-sharp proboscis waiting at the end of its oversized snout. Gifted with the ability of flight, the Stirge dives down upon an unsuspecting enemy and clamps onto their body with the aid of their barbed claws. The Stirge then drives its proboscis into their victim's flesh, sucking out ounce after ounce of warm blood. Only when the Stirge is sufficiently sated (or battered away) will it release its victim to flee into the darkness where it may digest its liquid lunch.

A unique feature of the Awakened Shrub is its indistinguishability between itself and an average shrub when it stands completely still. The ability to camouflage themselves so thoroughly allows the Awakened Shrubs to act as sentires for a more secretive druid’s hideaway.</p>\n<p>As recommended to me by a friend of the forest: be advised to utilize the shrubs in small groups as to simply overwhelm any nosey intruders. Strength in numbers is key for these simplistic shrubs as they may be easily dispatched if singled out. As the magic within the shrub allows the shrubs to speak a language known to their creator, Awakened Shrubs may also be programmed with a warning message and avoid conflict altogether.

The cat proves time and time again to be a prized companion whether they are keeping your property free of unwanted pests or cuddling up upon their master’s lap for a cozy night within the study. Found in a number of varieties from the pure black short-haired cats associated with ill omens to the fluffy coated and absurdly flat-faced cats of the frozen north, there appears to be limitless breeds to select from. (Author’s Note: I have recently heard rumor of a cat which produces no hair, requiring its master to simply stroke its flesh without pleasant barriers. More evidence forthcoming of this unfounded discovery). However, our feline compatriots have much more to offer when looked at under the shrewd eye of the adventurer!</p>\n<p><strong>Purrfect Pals.</strong> Be it at the side of the elder potion-maker tucked safely away in their shop or out with the upstart young ranger braving the rolling fields of the hinterlands, cats are found dotted all across our marvelous land. Compact and light in weight, these agile little hunters fit perfectly atop one’s shoulder or nestled within a wagon’s goods. Cats provide useful utility to the crafty conjurer who binds their familiar to such a form as well; with honed claws able to retract in a lighting’s flash back into their paws the cat makes for a deadly hunter against smaller beasts. Cats also have a flexible spine allowing them to squeeze into difficult to reach places should you coax them adequately or even survive a perilous fall. Researchers have discovered that cats seem to have the uncanny ability to land upon their feet regardless of the angle at which they are dropped; surely this is an astonishing advantage over other less agile creatures! Deathly quiet (unless they prefer to pester their master for tasty morsels with a noisome yowl) a cat is an adequate infiltrator should one prefer to observe their surroundings from a safer distance through this familiar’s eyes.

On the outside, the hound appears to be quite similar to many a hunting mutt: a tannish, yellow complexion of the fur, average in size (standing anywhere from two and a half to three feet in height) and no markings or traits rendering it particularly unique.&nbsp; However, the secret of this dog lies within.&nbsp; The Blink Dog possesses an uncanny ability to “blink” or teleport at will from location to location in a flash.&nbsp; In a similar vein to the spells utilized by mages to transport themselves across distances in a flash, the Blink Dog tears through the fabric of our reality, vanishes instantaneously and appears up to forty feet away from its original location.&nbsp; The Blink Dog is unable to carry living things along with it, however any equipment or objects the hound currently holds will be transported.&nbsp; Blink Dogs have an above average intelligence in comparison to other canines and are able to speak their own language, called “Blink Dog”, to others of their kind.&nbsp; What these discussions entail is a mystery, though it is speculated that often the packs of dogs will discuss their intense hatred for other ethereal quadrupeds as they are known to attack the beasts on sight.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Lawful Good","race":null,"type":"Fey","environment":"Forest","cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"MM pg. 318","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"Blink Dog;understands Sylvan but can't speak it"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13,"prof":0,"total":3},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":13,"prof":2,"total":3},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13,"prof":0,"total":3},"ste":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":15,"prof":2,"total":5},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"NBkyFFhtTwdmFhsp","sort":1400000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/fey/BlinkDog.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Blink Dog","displayName":0,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/fey/BlinkDog.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"jOANE6M0My6UJF4e","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{},"bar2":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"BNRcaqutWC30200X","name":"Keen Hearing and Smell","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The dog has<strong> advantage </strong>on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":"","type":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"The dog sharpens its senses!","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":"","value":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell","value":""},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"attunement":0},"sort":100000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/blue_29.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"DcZYdK2iycSJzamK","name":"Bite","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+3 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one target.

Here we will view the commonalities of what would be considered the “bandit” class of criminal. Be advised while reviewing this information that not all bandits should be viewed with a scornful eye. While many seek harm or riches from their quarry, others thieve to survive in a world most unfair.</p>\n<p><strong>The Good.</strong> We begin with those bandits who could be seen as “noble criminals”. These bandits consist of the most downtrodden of our nations, those citizens who have struggled through poverty and oppression to scrape out a meager existence clinging to any comfort they can grasp. Consider what would drive a person to commit something so desperate as robbery or open theft in a village street. Bandits of a nobler sort may still be selfish with their earnings, taking what they have stolen to enrich their own lives or those of immediate relations. There are some bandits, however, who seek to use their pilfered goods to improve the lives of the poorer community. Be aware that often these bandits are desperate and afraid, especially during the act of robbery. They are scared, driven to crime by poor circumstances, so they may not require violence to disperse as more often than not they will not physically harm their victims. Keep an open mind as you travel through the world young adventurer and remember that were the tables turned, you may wish for mercy for such a minor infraction.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bad and Ugly.</strong> For every good-hearted soul stealing from those with too much and giving to the unfortunate, there is a truly villainous spirit lurking behind the brush of a nearby road, lying in wait for an unsuspecting victim. During your travels, adventurer, these sorts may be the most common instances of banditry you will experience. Armed with swords, clubs, and bows, the more nefarious of the bandit world prefer to ambush their prey from the shadows of hills and trees, catching traveling parties unaware.

Tribal warriors act not like the guards of the city gates; rather, they function on hierarchies of honor, physical prowess, and in the legacy of deeds won in battle. Equipped with simple weapons such as spears, shortswords, or blunt maces the tribal warrior thrives within the heat of a battle, relishing in the decimation of their enemies. Theirs is a world of power struggles played upon the field of war rather than behind the closed doors of a council chamber. While one on one fights may be availed to combatants who prove themselves a worthy challenge, the tribal warrior is often not far from their allies. Utilizing simple combat techniques to pincer or route adversaries, the tribal warrior is no stranger to guerilla combat. Should you enter a tribe's hard won territory it will be likely that the tribe was alerted miles ahead of your approach to their borders. Be cautious, be wise, and keep an eye upon the rustling trees of the roadways should you stray into a land most unfamiliar. Tribal warriors respect honor and might, should you show them both then bloodshed of a greater order may be quickly avoided.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"any alignment","race":null,"type":"Humanoid","environment":null,"cr":0.125,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":25},"source":"MM pg. 350","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"any one language"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"RcadGAsg9rF7lRq9","sort":500000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/TribalWarriorM.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Tribal Warrior","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/TribalWarriorM.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"nREPw9g94Bsb9sIl","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"hbpux5uhl63ObLBg","name":"Hide Armor","type":"equipment","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts.

The necromantic magics used within the ritual can either be cast by a trained hand or simply seep into the bones of the skeleton in areas of concentrated death.&nbsp; Cemeteries, catacombs, and battle fields are all subject to the sporadic rising of skeletons into their new lives.&nbsp; The magic not only keeps the skeleton “living”, but it also binds joints and bones together like spectral ligaments.&nbsp; With its second life, the skeleton acts as a semi-mindless creature serving its master’s will.</p>\n<p><strong>Spooky Scary.</strong> For the up and coming necromancer, skeletons make worthy guards for a hidden repository of forbidden knowledge.&nbsp; Skeletons will follow simple to mildly complex orders given (such as forming a protective circle or constructing minor defenses) without the necromancer needing to worry about the durability of their creations.&nbsp; The skeletons will avoid danger and refuse to injure themselves unless explicitly ordered by their master.&nbsp; Skeletons do seem to grow rather bored without direction and have been observed ambling around an area performing simple actions from their past lives.&nbsp; One notable skeleton I recall was still able to cast their fishing line, though clumsily at best, into the nearby lake.&nbsp; Skeletons, however, are not utilized for their prior skills but as guardians of the necromancer who summoned them back from the hells.&nbsp; Skeletons are more than capable when swinging a sword or firing a crossbow, finding martial prowess in death that they may have lacked in life thanks to the dark power flowing through their marrow.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Author’s Note: Not all skeletal adversaries in an adventurer’s journey will be humanoid.&nbsp;

Approximately the size of an adult human’s fist, these tiny beasts are ravenous when they sense any scrap of food is nearby. The quipper’s jaw is lined with a jagged row of dagger-sharp teeth which they use to strip flesh from bones at lightning speed. The quipper’s ability to see even within the darkness of a frigid cavern lake makes them extremely deadly to the unwary traveler who takes an accidental plunge into the darkened waters. Though it is not entirely unheard of to see quippers on their own it is far more common that they travel in swirling swarms. These clouds of razor-toothed fish can sense blood in the water from great distances, able to sniff a single drop of the life giving fluid in over 200 liters of water.

Thinking myself a rather clever sleuth in finding some ill-witted bandit’s secret treasures, I did quickly reach my hand within the tunnel only to be greeted by something oddly fuzzy and a most severe pain to boot! Let my incident (and missing finger) with the woodland badger be warning to those lacking in wisdom; do not reach into places where your hand does not belong!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>- Merchant Lord Ellemond Doughty.</p>\n<p>The common forest dwelling badger is a creature of ingenuity and sheer determination. This creature, resembling a most rotund and powerful weasel, busies itself upon the forest floor catching its prey of insects and small mammals all the while toiling away at creating itself a sett, or more commonly called, a burrow. The badger’s coat is decked in marvelous black and white stripes running the length of its body. With gentle eyes and an otherwise calm demeanor, the badger exudes an image of a more timid beast; however, this outer appearance should be observed with caution. Armed with thick, elongated claws made for churning through the toughest of soil and a set of powerful jaws to match, badgers are quick to defend themselves should a foolish soul harass them. As long as you do not agitate the badger, it will find no recourse to harm you.</p>\n<p><strong>Miraculous Mandibles.</strong> A badger’s most intriguing feature is a set of peculiar jawbones with provide it with a spectacular method of defense. The animal’s jaws are set into long cavities within its skull allowing the badger to lock its jaws in place thus increasing its already powerful bite strength and avoid the possibility of mandible dislocation. A truly remarkable evolutionary advantage in avoiding combat (rather than confronting its adversary) is the badger’s natural odor. These creatures can release a powerful musk from scent glands located near their rears which can easily drive away predators. It is for these reasons that many forest dwelling cultures revere the badger as a guardian of the forest and attempt to utilize the badger’s unique abilities in their own bid for survival in the wilds of our world.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Unaligned","race":null,"type":"Beast","environment":"Forest","cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg. 318","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"tiny","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"NBkyFFhtTwdmFhsp","sort":100000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/Badger.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Badger","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/Badger.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":30,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"oQvORD924obyPdCc","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"hwviWX3lRj9wqENj","name":"Keen Smell","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The badger has<strong> advantage </strong>on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"wis","actionType":"abil","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"The badger sniffs around!","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":"","value":""},"formula":"2d20kh + @skills.prc.total","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell","value":""},"requirements":"Badger","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"attunement":0},"sort":100000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/blue_29.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"siQuRYBFdjgVrKlA","name":"Bite","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+2 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one target.

Bats are a nocturnal creature prized by arcanists for their ability to navigate terrain in near total darkness. This alone makes them a prized choice for a summoned familiar. Varying from the size of a mouse to that of a house cat, bats have a unique feature amongst mammals: the gift of flight! Stretched thin between needle-thin boney “hands” are fleshy membranes which span out wide from the bat’s delicate body, allowing the bats to take to the skies in search of insects and woodland fruits to indulge upon.</p>\n<p><strong>Chitter Chatter.</strong> Presumed blind by many from nonsense tales told to children, bats have eyesight nearly akin to our own, though notably less sharp. What makes these creatures truly unique is their ability to navigate in the pitch black of night. The bats utilize a series of chirps and screeches researchers have dubbed “echolocation” to pinpoint objects or prey within their flightpath. The echolocation chirps emitted by the bats bounce back towards the tiny creature’s proportionally massive ears, allowing the bats to make split second corrections to their navigation without the aid of their eyes. It should be again noted that the bat makes a clever familiar choice, as they may navigate those places too dim and dangerous for our mortal eyes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten

Cultists, as their name describes, are those members of a secret underground society (or cult) whom very often practice a dark and unholy religion with their fellows. Beware adventurer! Not every cult is simply based around religious pretexts, there are those who seek political movements, those who are power hungry, and those who deign to meddle with forces our histories have lost long ago. Let me describe for you the very basics of common cult activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Friends on the Other Side.</strong> Cultists operate entirely in secrecy outside of the normal comings and goings of everyday life. What makes the cultist so fascinating is that they often attempt to blend seamlessly in with common folk: the barkeep at your favorite tavern, the guard near the gate, or even the dancer upon the stage may all be part of an underground community based ostensibly in evil. Now, to be clear, I do not encourage paranoia as cult activity is relatively rare in comparison to other, more immediate threats to our world; however, should a clever adventurer keep a keen eye out for secretive motions or gestures, odd symbols or markings, and even whispered code words, they can be certain they have stumbled into the workings of a cult. Quite commonly cultists align themselves with an ancient power trapped or dormant somewhere upon one of the more foul planes of existence. Their goals with this dark, godly force are myriad but often include control of a political structure, the deaths of hundreds if not thousands, or simply to sew despair and chaos across the realms of mortals. Unlike the desperate and cowardly bandits pushed to the brink by circumstance, cultists are often irredeemable foes. These men and women have been programed, brain-washed, or even directly controlled by their benefactor into the ways of darkness; often they are unfortunately unable to return to society once they have ingratiated themselves too deeply within the cult's network.

As I peered into the first circle of the Nine Hells I did spy the quarry of my search with relative ease, The Maggot Pit. Here, deep within the valley of a parched and cracking mountain range lay a pit perhaps a mile in diameter, flanked all around by devilish guards. Within the milky pit writhed millions of ghostly pale worms, biting and squirming beneath their fellows. It was here that the lowly devils did bring up cart after cart piled high with the wretched and weakened souls of the pitiful dead, who were unceremoniously prodded to the edge of the pit and thrown within the writhing “waters” below. The sight of the lamentable being that emerged from that pool haunts my visions to this very day…&nbsp;<br><em>- Alaband the Curious, Mage in the Circle of the Constellar.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Wretched and foul, the Lemure is perhaps the weakest being to emerge shrieking from the Nine Hells into our plane of existence. Lemures resemble nothing more than a living ooze which has attempted to take the form of something vaguely humanoid. A malformed head with humanoid features sits atop the puddle of a creature, its pink and rotting flesh slithering beneath two stunted arms. Only able to cry out incoherently, the Lemure acts at the whim of its infernal masters, reduced in this form to a babbling fool. These creatures are the first troops sent through to another plane as the infantry in a never ending war which the Archdevils of the Nine Hells wage upon their foes. Though the Lemure has nearly no will of its own, the creature does have the strength to return to life should it be killed within its home of the Nine Hells. Be sure to pack a fair portion of holy water or utilize a Bless incantation should you slay on of these beasts in the realm of the devils, lest it only return to life within the Maggot Pit a few days after its demise.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Lawful

Hailing from roots similar to antelope and sheep, the goat has become a mainstay in the world of domesticated farm animals. Goats resemble something of a shorn sheep with thick, bristle-like fur and small hooves adorning their nimble feet. Atop the goat&rsquo;s head rests a set of hard horns which, depending upon the species, can vary from short and knobby to long curled protrusions. The goats use their horns for both defense and contests of strength between fellow males (or billies) during spectacular ramming matches. The clattering of mountain goats&rsquo; horns can be heard clearly throughout the valley towns during the creature&rsquo;s mating seasons.</p>\n<p><strong>Of Evil and Garbage.</strong> Goats can be called nothing if not resourceful when it comes to what they choose to ingest. Goats will typically feed upon grass and weeds found in their favored open fields; however, several shepherds have noted their goats eating such objects as iron nails, bits of discarded clothing, and even the wheels of a wagon! The image of a goat has also been co opted by some of the more nefarious of our realm as a symbol of evil to represent various foul cults. Perhaps it is the goat&rsquo;s sinister horizontal pupil that elicits fear in onlookers or their common use by some cultures as a ritualistic sacrifice that drives the cults to utilize their visage.

are the largest of the wild dog species roaming the plains and forests of our wonderful world.&nbsp; Anywhere from light brown to a midnight black in coloration, wolves stand as the common ancestor to all natural dog species currently inhabiting the planet.&nbsp; Wolves have a long, broad muzzle filled with sharp teeth, a thick coat to insulate them from difficult winters, and keen eyes and ears with which they may track a target.&nbsp; The most amazing aspect of the wolf is its incredible nose which can smell prey from up to one and a half miles away.&nbsp; This amazing nose (packed with hundreds of millions of scent receptors) can also determine the mood of other wolves, what they’ve eaten, and even where they’ve been..</p>\n<p><strong>The Wolves Among Us.</strong> As is common with many other dog species, wolves live in communities called packs.&nbsp; WIthin the pack, wolves hunt together, raise their young together, and provide group protection.&nbsp; When encountering wolves, be wary should you only spy a single animal prowling the area.&nbsp; It’s quite likely where there is a straggler wolf, the rest of the pack lurks nearby ready to defend their family from attack.&nbsp; Wolves, which unable to speak, are able to “communicate” via barks and growls as well as follow simplistic tactics such as flanking maneuvers or surprise attacks.&nbsp; The strength of the pack allows for the wolves to combine their intelligence and form a deadly fighting force of gnashing teeth.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary
