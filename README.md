# Castles and Crusades Support for Foundry VTT
Castles and Crusades RPG system for the Foundry Virtual Tabletop.

Manifest URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/switchspan/foundryvtt-cnc/main/system.json

_Note that this system does not contain content from the Castles & Crusades players handbook, only rollable character sheets. Once Foundry supports discrete copyright-protectable compendia, we will work with Troll Lord Games to get that content ready for out-of-the-box use. In the mean time, please see the user guide for how to import content from the PDF rulebook for your personal use._
